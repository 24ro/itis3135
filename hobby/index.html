        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Me and my hobby</h3>
        <p>
          As a person who grew up being outside a lot and playing different
          sports, I found a hobby and an interest in playing soccer or fútbol.
          It was the game the whole neighborhood would be playing anytime I went
          outside. At times it became a slightly dangerous game because of the
          lengths we would go to just play the game. Jumping over barb wire
          fences and running onto the train tracks to get our ball back never
          stopped us from playing our beloved game. Overall, I've enjoyed this
          game from the unorganized games in the concrete streets to the
          organized games on fields made for the sport.
        </p>
        <h3>My Experience:</h3>
        <p>
          This sport was the most accessible to me growing up. It was always
          around me at home, at school, and the parks. I've been around it since
          I was five. I've played on some organized teams as well but it has
          always remained a hobby to help decompress, compete, and stay fit. As
          mentioned earlier I've played unorganized ball but I spent time on
          some club and school teams. So, at one point it became more than just
          a hobby. For brief moment in time the classic young boy's decision to
          go pro came about. As you can tell, it was shortlived.

        <h3>What is Soccer?</h3>
        <p>
          Soccer is objectively the world's biggest sport. FIFA claims that the
          World Cup final was watched by around 1.5 billion people world wide.
          It is one of those sports that brings the world together on the big
          stage. It has a rich history across the globe in countries like
          Brazil, Nigeria, France, England, Argentina, South Africa, etc. It has
          all types of rivalries. Some inter-continental, some cross-country,
          and even some between the neighboring cities in your country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're in the know about the global influence of soccer or
          not. Its influence and reach cannot be denied.

        <h2>Best Locations to play</h2>
        <h3>Local Fields</h3>
        <p>
          Local soccer fields and parks are the ideal locations. It is one of
          the safer options and there should be no disruptions from people
          telling you're not allowed to play there.
        </p>
        <h3>Stadiums</h3>
        <p>
          If you can access any stadiums, go for it. Then you can imagine fans
          yelling your name as you dribble the ball. I played in a college
          stadium once but sadly no fans cheered my name.
        </p>
        <h3>Indoor Arenas</h3>
        <p>
          Indoor soccer arenas are perfect for playing soccer year-round. Rain,
          wind, nor heat will be an obstacle in there.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Best Times</h2>
        <h3>Summer/Fall afternoons</h3>
        <p>
          The best times for soccer are usually in the late afternoon or early
          evening when the weather is cooler and players have more energy. The
          sun is not beaming on your neck and the breeze might be perfect enough
          to cool off the sweat from playing.
        </p>
       
        <h3>Match Days</h3>
        <p>
          Match days are overall the best days to play. Now on top of the fun,
          there is competition. There is the thrill of a win or loset situation
          and the intensity of a possible win or go home situation. Also,
          typicall the excitement and anticipation of match day create a
          thrilling atmosphere for players and fans alike.

        <h2>Why</h2>
        <h3>Passion for the Game</h3>
        <p>
          Soccer is more than just a sport – it's a passion that drives millions
          of people worldwide. The thrill of competition, the camaraderie among
          teammates, and the joy of scoring a goal make soccer an unforgettable
          experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
        <p>
          Playing soccer offers a multitude of health benefits. It is good for cardio, mental health, mobility, agility and strength. Your cardiovascular system will be thanking you from all the cardio done in soccer.
        </p>
        <h3>Social Unity</h3>
        <p>
          Soccer brings the world together, fostering friendships and creating
          lasting memories. Step into any bar when the world cup is on and see
          for yourself. I myself saw students flocking to watch the games from
          the last world cup and saw a variety of flags. Whether you're playing
          on a team or cheering from the sidelines, soccer provides
          opportunities for social interaction and community involvement.
